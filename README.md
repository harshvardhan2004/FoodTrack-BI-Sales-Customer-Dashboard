# 🍕 BizInsights Dashboard – Sales & Customer Analytics

## 📌 Overview  
This project demonstrates how raw transactional data can be transformed into **business insights** using **SQL** and **Power BI**.  
I designed and analyzed a fictional restaurant chain’s sales database to answer real business questions:  

- What are the **peak hours and best-performing days**?  
- Which products drive the **most revenue and profit**?  
- Who are the **most loyal customers**?  
- How can the restaurant optimize staffing and inventory decisions?  

The result is an **interactive dashboard** that helps business stakeholders track **key KPIs** and make **data-driven decisions**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform **data cleaning & transformation** with SQL queries.  
- Build **KPI-driven dashboards** in Power BI.  
- Apply **business analytics thinking** (not just reporting).  
- Tell a clear **data story** that translates numbers into actions.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used
- **SQL** → data extraction, aggregation, joins, window functions  
- **Power BI** → dashboard creation, data visualization  
- **Excel** → basic validation & exploration  
- **Business Insight Storytelling** → presenting results in actionable form  

---

## 📊 Key Metrics & KPIs
- **Total Sales & Revenue Growth**  
- **Top Selling Products**
