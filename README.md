#  FoodTrack BI Dashboard – Sales & Customer Analytics

##  Overview  
This project demonstrates how raw transactional data can be transformed into **business insights** using **SQL** and **Power BI**.  
I designed and analyzed a fictional restaurant chain’s sales database to answer real business questions:  

- What are the **peak hours and best-performing days**?  
- Which products drive the **most revenue and profit**?  
- Who are the **most loyal customers**?  
- How can the restaurant optimize staffing and inventory decisions?  

The result is an **interactive dashboard** that helps business stakeholders track **key KPIs** and make **data-driven decisions**.  

---

##  Objectives
- Perform **data cleaning & transformation** with SQL queries.  
- Build **KPI-driven dashboards** in Power BI.  
- Apply **business analytics thinking** (not just reporting).  
- Tell a clear **data story** that translates numbers into actions.  

---

##  Tools & Skills Used
- **SQL** → data extraction, aggregation, joins, window functions  
- **Power BI** → dashboard creation, data visualization  
- **Excel** → basic validation & exploration  
- **Business Insight Storytelling** → presenting results in actionable form  

---

##  Key Metrics & KPIs
- **Total Sales & Revenue Growth**  
- **Top Selling Products**  
- **Hourly & Daily Sales Trends**  
- **Repeat Customer Rate**  
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**

##  Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection** – Imported restaurant sales dataset (CSV format).  
2. **Data Cleaning (SQL)** – Removed duplicates, handled nulls, formatted dates.  
3. **Exploratory Queries (SQL)** – Ran aggregation queries to identify trends.  
4. **Dashboard Development (Power BI)** – Built interactive visuals for stakeholders.  
5. **Insight Generation** – Connected results back to **staffing, marketing, and inventory** actions.

##  Business Impact
- Helped identify **slow vs peak hours** → staffing optimization.  
- Revealed **low-performing menu items** → product revamp decisions.  
- Highlighted **loyal customers** → potential for targeted loyalty programs.  
- Enabled **data-driven revenue forecasting** → improved management planning.  

---

##  Learnings
- How SQL can go beyond queries to **power decision-making**.  
- How dashboards should **tell a story** instead of just plotting numbers.  
- How to bridge the gap between **data analyst and business problem-solver**.  

---

##  Future Improvements
- Automate daily data refresh with Power BI Service.  
- Add customer segmentation (RFM analysis).  
- Expand to multi-branch sales data for deeper insights.
